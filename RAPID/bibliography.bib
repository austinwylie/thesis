@book{Lidwell2003,
abstract = {Whether a marketing campaign or a museum exhibit, a video game or a complex control system, the design we see is the culmination of many concepts and practices brought together from a variety of disciplines. Because no one can be an expert on everything, designers have always had to scramble to find the information and know-how required to make a design work until now. Universal Principles of Design is the first comprehensive, cross-disciplinary encyclopedia of design. Richly illustrated and easy to navigate, it pairs clear explanations of every design concept with visual examples of the concepts applied in practice. From the "80/20 rule to chunking, from baby-face bias to Ockham's razor, and from self-similarity to storytelling, every major design concept is defined and illustrated for readers to expand their knowledge. This landmark reference will become the standard for designers, engineers, architects, and students who seek to broaden and improve their design expertise.},

abstract = {Major advances characterize the Generation-V dual-Purkinje-image (DPI) eyetracker compared with the Generation-III version previously described. These advances include a large reduction in size, major improvements in frequency response and noise level, automatic alignment to a subject, and automatic adjustment for different separation between the visual and optic axes, which can vary considerably from subject to subject. In a number of applications described in the paper, the eyetracker is coupled with other highly specialized optical devices. These applications include accurately stabilizing an image on a subject's retina; accurately simulating a visually dead retinal region (i.e., a scotoma) of arbitrary shape, size, and position; and, for clinical purposes, stabilizing the position of a laser coagulator beam on a patient's retina so that the point of contact is unaffected by the patient's own eye movements.},

abstract = {The purpose of the Abstract Specification is to document a conceptual model sufficient enough to allow for the creation of OGC Implementation Standards. The Abstract Specification consists of two models derived from the Syntropy object analysis and design methodology [1]. The first and simpler model is called the Essential Model and its purpose is to establish the conceptual linkage of the software or system design to the real world. The Essential Model is a description of how the world works (or should work). The second model, the meat of the Abstract Specification, is the Abstract Model that defines the eventual software system in an implementation neutral manner. The Abstract Model is a description of how software should work. The Abstract Model represents a compromise between the paradigms of the intended target implementation environments. The Abstract Specification is organized into separate topic volumes in order to manage the complexity of the subject matter and to assist parallel development of work items by different Working Groups of the OGC Technical Committee. The topics are, in reality, dependent upon one another⎯ each one begging to be written first. Each topic must be read in the context of the entire Abstract Specification.},

This volume also covers the special-purpose interfaces and architectures required to interact with and share spatial information, and explains the importance of uncertainty and time. The material on GIS architectures and interfaces as well as spatiotemporal information systems is almost entirely new.The second edition contains substantial new information, and has been completely reformatted to improve accessibility. Changes include:A new chapter on spatial uncertainty Complete revisions of the bibliography, index, and supporting diagrams Supplemental material is offset at the top of the page, as are references and links for further study Definitions of new terms are in the margins of pages where they appear, with corresponding entries in the index},

We experimented to investigate the relation between the quantitative data viewing behavior of users and web usability evaluation by subjects. We analyzed the data to detect low usability web pages using discriminant analysis. Low usability web pages, 94.4\% (17pages / 18pages = detectable pages / low usability pages) were detectable from the moving speed of gazing points and the amount of wheel rolling of a mouse. Moreover, this detection reduced the number of web pages which should be evaluated by half (46\% = 89 pages / 192 pages = detected pages / all pages).},

@book{Martin2008,
abstract = {Even bad code can function. But if code isnt clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesnt have to be that way.Noted software expert Robert C. Martin, presents a revolutionary paradigm with Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship. Martin, who has helped bring agile principles from a practitioners point of view to tens of thousands of programmers, has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code on the fly into a book that will instill within you the values of software craftsman, and make you a better programmerbut only if you work at it.What kind of work will you be doing? Youll be reading codelots of code. And you will be challenged to think about whats right about that code, and whats wrong with it. More importantly you will be challenged to reassess your professional values and your commitment to your craft. Clean Code is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up codeof transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and smells gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code. Readers will come away from this book understanding How to tell the difference between good and bad code How to write good code and how to transform bad code into good code How to create good names, good functions, good objects, and good classes How to format code for maximum readability How to implement complete error handling without obscuring code logic How to unit test and practice test-driven development What smells and heuristics can help you identify bad code This book is a must for any developer, software engineer, project manager, team lead, or systems analyst with an interest in producing better code.},

@inproceedings{Piccioni2013,
abstract = {Modern software development extensively involves reusing library components accessed through their Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Usability is therefore a fundamental goal of API design, but rigorous empirical studies of API usability are still relatively uncommon. In this paper, we present the design of an API usability study which combines interview questions based on the cognitive dimensions framework, with systematic observations of programmer behavior while solving programming tasks based on ``tokens''. We also discuss the implementation of the study to assess the usability of a persistence library API (offering functionalities such as storing objects into relational databases). The study involved 25 programmers (including students, researchers, and professionals), and provided additional evidence to some critical features evidenced by related studies, such as the difficulty of finding good names for API features and of discovering relations between API types. It also discovered new issues relevant to API design, such as the impact of flexibility, and confirmed the crucial importance of accurate documentation for usability.},

@book{Gamma1995,
abstract = {Capturing a wealth of experience about the design of object-oriented software, four top-notch designers present a catalog of simple and succinct solutions to commonly occurring design problems. Previously undocumented, these 23 patterns allow designers to create more flexible, elegant, and ultimately reusable designs without having to rediscover the design solutions themselves. The authors begin by describing what patterns are and how they can help you design object-oriented software. They then go on to systematically name, explain, evaluate, and catalog recurring designs in object-oriented systems. With Design Patterns as your guide, you will learn how these important patterns fit into the software development process, and how you can leverage them to solve your own design problems most efficiently. Each pattern describes the circumstances in which it is applicable, when it can be applied in view of other design constraints, and the consequences and trade-offs of using the pattern within a larger design. All patterns are compiled from real systems and are based on real-world examples. Each pattern also includes code that demonstrates how it may be implemented in object-oriented programming languages like C++ or Smalltalk. 0201633612B07092001},

@book{Worboys2004,
abstract = {GIS: A Computing Perspective, Second Edition, provides a full, up-to-date overview of GIS, both Geographic Information Systems and the study of Geographic Information Science. Analyzing the subject from a computing perspective, the second edition explores conceptual and formal models needed to understand spatial information, and examines the representations and data structures needed to support adequate system performance. This volume also covers the special-purpose interfaces and architectures required to interact with and share spatial information, and explains the importance of uncertainty and time. The material on GIS architectures and interfaces as well as spatiotemporal information systems is almost entirely new.The second edition contains substantial new information, and has been completely reformatted to improve accessibility. Changes include:A new chapter on spatial uncertainty Complete revisions of the bibliography, index, and supporting diagrams Supplemental material is offset at the top of the page, as are references and links for further study Definitions of new terms are in the margins of pages where they appear, with corresponding entries in the index},
