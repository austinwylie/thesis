RAPID was designed to fulfill Chapter~\ref{requirements}'s enumerated system requirements.

% It seems natural to begin this discussion where a user or client application would begin their interactions with RAPID: adding data to the system.



% Modification to "Feature" concept - we have additional properties

% Keep file around for various uses

% When a dataset is added to the system, it is validated, reads the input format, and adds it to the database in the appropriate models.

% Note on Django models converting to SQL

% Option to strip comments / keep original file / formatting
