My thesis would not be what it is today (read: finished) without invaluable support and instruction. Several people have my deepest thanks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Dr. Alex Dekhtyar for advice, encouragement, and skills to work with biologists.
    \item Dr. Chris Lupo for the Picture of the Day, and teaching me to throw hardware at the problem.
    \item Alexa Francis---a solid teammate and neighbor---for learning about Web Feature Services with me.
    \item My parents, Suzi and Patrick, for academic cheerleading and a bunch of love.
\end{itemize}
