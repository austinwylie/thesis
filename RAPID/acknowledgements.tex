My thesis would not be what it is today (read: finished) without invaluable support and instruction from many people. This group has my deepest thanks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Dr. Alex Dekhtyar for advice, encouragement, and knowledge to work with biologists.
    \item Dr. Chris Lupo for teaching me to throw hardware at the problem. And the Picture of the Day.
    \item Alexa Francis---a solid classmate and neighbor---for learning about Web Feature Services with me.
    \item My parents, Suzi and Patrick, for academic cheerleading and a bunch of love.
\end{itemize}
